## LinkedIn Puzzle Solver

This project is a JavaFX desktop application that provides interactive solvers for two logic puzzles: **LinkedIn Queens** and **LinkedIn Tango**. It features graphical user interfaces for both puzzles, allowing users to set up boards, customize parameters, and visualize solutions.

### Features

- **Queens Solver:**  
  - Interactive N-Queens variant with customizable board size (5â€“11).
  - Color-coded board setup using a color picker.
  - Visual placement and solution display for queens.
  - Board clearing and resizing functionality.

- **Tango Solver:**  
  - Interactive grid for the LinkedIn Tango puzzle (default size 6x6).
  - Place Sun and Moon icons and set edge types (normal, equals, cross).
  - Visual feedback for cell and edge states.
  - Grid clearing and solving actions.

- **Unified Application:**  
  - Both solvers are accessible from a single application window.
  - Switch between puzzles using keyboard shortcuts (`Q` for Queens, `T` for Tango).
  - Modern JavaFX interface with responsive controls.
